                                <p>I am a charismatic and an outgoing individual who can naturally interact with people. During discussions I can listen and respond to opinions of other people and can put across my opinion as well. I am always reliable and responsible, with every intention of fulfilling my potential in everything I do. I prefer to stay within a close group of friends, however, despite this, I can co-operate with and merge with other social groups and easily create connections with my fellow peers. I also speak Urdu which helps to widen my friendship groups. Throughout my school years and life outside of school, I have had many different interests and hobbies such as: Table Tennis, Playing Cricket and Cycling, however I must admit that Programming is one of my favourite interests. I enjoy the main aspect of programming as it involves lots of problem-solving skills as well as thinking computationally.  I love solving algorithms and I am always seeking out further knowledge. In my spare time I chill with my family. I like to keep family close to me as they are all very supportive and help me to plough through my days.</p>

                                <p>Earlier this year I had Built and Programmed my own RC Car using a Raspberry Pi (I included various ways of control such as Keyboard, Phone, Gyroscope and using an Xbox 360 controller. I had done this all from scratch). I have also programmed my own facial detection system using OpenCV. As you can tell, I really enjoy programming. As mentioned before, I wish to pursue deeper into Computer Science and i have decide to go into the Electrical/Software Engineering Sector in the future.</p>

                                <p>I have had some work experience. I have worked at Everest Pharmacy in Year 10 for 2 weeks. Within my time that I worked, I acquired unique and valuable skills such as time management, how to organize my working environment, how to deal with customers, efficiently sorting out medicines in alphabetical order, dealing with confidential data and placed orders for the pharmacy. This has allowed me use my expert knowledge in day-to-day tasks so that I can perform to the very best of my ability efficiently.</p>
